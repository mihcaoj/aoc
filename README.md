# Advent of Code

These are my solutions to Advent of Code puzzles in Go. ðŸŽ„

## How to run the solutions

If you don't have it, [install Go](https://go.dev/dl/).

### Clone the repo and change directory
```bash
git clone https://github.com/mihcaoj/aoc
cd aoc
```

### Choose year and day, for example
```bash
cd 2024/day02
```

Each Advent of Code input is unique to your account. 
You can go get it here: https://adventofcode.com/2024/day/2/input
Copy your input and save it as a file named "input.txt" in the current directory.

### Finally, run the solutions
```bash
go run .
```
